## To Do

-   make queries asynchronous using MySQL2 `.promise()` function on Connections https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2

## Notes

-   `pizza.js` is just an example, delete it later.

## Questions

-   why does using `express.router()` in `employee-tracker.js` cause server to crash?

## Lessons Learned

### SQL

-   No need to/can't reuse the same `CONSTRAINT` column name. E.g.
    -   I need to know the department for employee
    -   the job_title table tells me the department that job title is part of
    -   I don't need to add department to the employee table
