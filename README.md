## To Do

-   make queries asynchronous using MySQL2 `.promise()` function on Connections https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2

## Repo Notes

-   `pizza.js` is just an example, delete it later.

## Lessons Learned

### SQL

-   No need to/can't reuse the same `CONSTRAINT` column name. E.g.
    -   I need to know the department for employee
    -   the job_title table tells me the department that job title is part of
    -   I don't need to add department to the employee table

### Switch Statements

-   ["whenever you need to use let or const declarations in a `case` clause, wrap it in a block."](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch#description)

### Promises

-   old timers dealt with "callback hell." They're thankful for `Promise` and even more thankful for ES8's async functions
